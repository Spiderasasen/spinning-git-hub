# spinning-git-hub
Done in Java, it will spin the logo of GitHub. When clicked, it will show the 2 devs of the new game World War Chess, and will be submitted to them to enter the dev logs section of the game

# main system
It will be on Java since the game was created in Java, and I'm close friends with the devs. The only requirement is that it will be in a  JFRAME to make it visible. 

# why spinning
I originally wanted to add something that spins to add something funny to the game section, but i didn't know what.
I know they have credits for their game, but i wanted to add a little more unique way to implement this and also use it as a way to promote both of there git hubs more, because they really worked hard on it.
