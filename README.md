# spinning-git-hub
Done in Java, it will spin the logo of GitHub. When clicked, it will show the 2 devs of the new game World War Chess, and will be submitted to them to enter the dev logs section of the game. Make it like my version of the credits screen if it were only the GitHub accounts. 

# main system
It will be on Java since the game was created in Java, and I'm close friends with the devs. The only requirement is that it will be in a  JFRAME to make it visible. 

# why spinning
I originally wanted to add something that spins to add something funny to the game section, but i didn't know what.
I know they have credits for their game, but i wanted to add a little more unique way to implement this and also use it as a way to promote both of there git hubs more, because they really worked hard on it.

# some functions
One of the main things is when the GitHub image is clicked, it will transition to another screen/panel with the images of all the devs plus mine, since i programmed this and it was my first time creating the Java code on jframe. But if you just want to admire the logo of the Github logo spinning in space, then clicking on the "The Devs" text will send you back using the same transition to get back.
